## Using GDB
Learn how to use GDB to debug your program.

#### compile with debug info
```bash
gcc -g -o test test.c # 直接编译为debug版本

# 或者在正常编译完成后再编译为debug版本
gcc -o test test.c
gcc -g test
```

#### run gdb
```bash
gdb test
```

### basic commands
```bash
# run the program
run # r

# quit gdb
quit # q

# list the source code
list # l

# set a breakpoint
# break can break at a function or a line
break main # b main
break 10 # b 10

# show breakpoints
info breakpoints # i b

# delete a breakpoint
delete 1 # d 1

# continue the program
continue # c

# step into a function
step # s
```

#### print variables
```bash
# print a variable
print a # p a

# print a variable with format
print /x a # p /x a

# print an array
print a@10 # p a@10
print a[0] # p a[0]

# print address of a variable
print &a # p &a
print &a[0] # p &a[0]
```

### advanced commands
```bash
# log the output to a file
set logging file gdb.log
set logging on

# shell command

shell ls
shell cat test.c
```

#### set watchpoint
Watchpoint is used to break when a variable is changed.
Can watch a address, a variable, or a expression.
```bash
# get the address of a variable
print &a
# set watchpoint
watch *0x7fffffffe0f0

# set watchpoint for a variable
watch a
watch a[0]

# set watchpoint for a expression
watch a + 1

# info watchpoints
info watchpoints
```
