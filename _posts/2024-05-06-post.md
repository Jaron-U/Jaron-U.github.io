## Operating System: Xv6 on RISC-V - Paging & Page Table

## Paging
* Physical memory partitioned into equal-sized page frames. The typical size of a page frame is 4KB. Other possible page sizes: 512B, 64KB, 1MB, 4MB, etc
* Memory only allocatied in page frames. No external fragmentation. Can still have internal fragmentation(no enought space left within a page frame).

### Physical Address
* A physical address can be split into a pait (f, o)
    * f: frame number (f_max frames)
    * o: offset within the frame (O_max bytes/frame)
* Physical address = f * O_max + o
* As long as frame size is power of 2, easy to split address using bitwise operations

#### Physical Address Example
Suppose a 16-bit address space with 512(2^9) byte page frames.  
Address 1542(0x0606) can be translated to:
* Frame: 1542 / 512 = 0x606 >> 9 = 3
* Offset: 1542 % 512 = 0x606 & 0x1ff = 6

### Virtual Address
* A process’s virtual address space is partitioned into equal-sized pages. A virtual address is a pair (p, o)   
**Virtual page size = Physical frame size**
    * p: page number (p_max pages)
    * o: offset within the page (O_max bytes/page)
* Virtual address = p * O_max + o

### Page Mapping
* 1:1 mapping of page-aligned virtual addresses to physical frames
* Imagine a big ole’ table (BOT):
    * Number of table entries = number of virtual page addresses/page size
* Address translation:
    * Virtual page number -> BOT entry -> Physical frame number
    * Add offset to physical frame number to get physical address
* Pages are contiguous in virtual address space, but not necessarily in physical address space
* Not all pages are mapped to physical memory at all times
    * Some pages may be swapped out to disk
    * Some pages may be shared between processes

## Page Table

### Dealing with Large Tables
* Add additional levels of page table
* Sub-dividing page number into k parts
![Multi-level Page Table](/images/os/os_lt.png)

A single-level, 1-1 page table takes enormous space.  
* Linked list – too slow to walk
* Hashed table – collision
* Multi-level page table

### 32-bit x86 Page Table
![32-bit x86 Page Table](/images/os/os_32pt.png)
* Each table is exactly one page. 4KB(4096) for x86
* Two-level of page table
    * Page Directory: 1024 entries
    * Page Table: 1024 entries
* CR3 (a control register): stores the physical base (PA >> 12) of the page directory table

### Page Table Entries(PTEs)
![Page Table Entries](/images/os/os_pte86.png)
* Fixed bits for the PFN (Page frame number) of the next PTs or pages.
    * Physical address = PFN * page size
* The remaining bits are used for flags, or reserved for OS use
    * P (Present): Is the page present or not?
    * R/W (Read/Write): Is the page read-only or readable/writable?
    * U/S (User or Supervisor): User or kernel page?
    * A (Accessed): page has been read
    * D (Dirty): page has been written
    * G (Global): page is shared among processes

### 32-bit Paging Example
![32-bit Paging Example](/images/os/os_32pe.png)
In the 32-bit x86 architecture, the size of the page is 4KB. So the offset need multiple 4.
* A 32-bit page table can reference up to 4GB of physical memory.

### Question 1
* If you have:
    * 34-bit address space (both VA & PA)
    * 1024-byte pages
    * Each PTE needs at least 6 flags and 2 bits reserved
    * How many levels of page tables?

#### Calculate the number of levels of page tables
* Offset: log2(1024) = 10 bits
* Virtual Page Number (VPN) Bits: 34 bits - 10 offset bits = 24 bits
* Physical Page Frame Number (PPN) Bits: 34 bits - 10 offset bits = 24 bits
* Page Table Entry (PTE) Size: Each PTE needs to hold the PPN (24 bits), 6 flags (F) and 2 reserved bits.  
    * PTE Size = PPN bits + F bits + reserved bits = 24 + 6 + 2 = 32 bits
* Number of bytes per PTE: 32 bits / 8 bits/byte = 4 bytes
* Levels of page tables (Multi-level paging):
    * The number of levels is determined by the size of the VPN and the maximum size a single page table can accommodate.
    * L = VPN bits / log2(page size/bytes per PTE)   
        = 24 / log2(1024/4)   
        = 24 / log2(256)  
        = 24 / 8  
        = 3 levels  

### Question 2
* How many levels of page tables are needed for 64-bit address space?
    * Each page is still 4KB
    * Each PTE or PDE or any intermediate-level entry is 64 bits (8 bytes)
    * Is it practical to map all 0~2^{64} -1 VAs to all 0~2^{64} -1 PAs?

#### Calculate the number of levels of page tables
* Number of PTEs per page: 4KB / 8 bytes = 512 PTEs
* PTE bits: 9 bits
* VPN bits: 64 bits - 12 offset bits = 52 bits
* Levels: 52 / 9 = 6 levels

### 64-bit Page Table (4-Level)
![64-bit Page Table](/images/os/os_64pt.png)

### RISC-V Page Table Entry
* Physical page number: Identifies 44-bit physical page location; MMU replaces virtual bits with these physical bits
* V: If set, an entry for this virtual address exists
* U: If set, userspace can access this virtual address
* X, W, R: If set, the CPU can execute, write, or read this virtual address

### RISC-V Page Table Flags

### Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
![TLB](/images/os/os_tlb.png)

### Managing TLB
* Address translations are mostly handled by TLB
* Software loaded TLB (OS); TLB miss faults to OS, OS finds right PTE and loads TLB; OS picks the page table format; May be slow (20-200 cycles typically)  
* Hardware (memory management unit (MMU)); Hardware knows where page tables are in memory (e.g., from CR3)

### Lager Page Size
* Even with TLB, TLB misses can be expensive
    * Happens at the first time any page is accessed (unless with TLB prefetching)
    * For random (non-sequential) access patterns, may have more TLB misses
* Making TLB misses cheaper -> Larger page sizes!
    * Pages larger than the default 4KB size -> Called huge pages or super pages
    * Huge pages can be any power of 2
* Minimizes TLB misses
* Reduces the number of page table entries
* Improves I/O performance

### Huge Pages
* Allocating huge pages can be hard
    * Need to allocate 2MB or 1GB contiguous physical memory
    * Causes external fragmentation
* Explicitly specifying huge pages
    * `mmap(NULL, 8*1024 *1024, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_HUGETLB, -1, 0))`
    * `madvise(ptr, 8*1024*1024, MADV_HUGEPAGE)` advice to the OS
* Transparently using huge pages
    * The OS can transparently replace continuous 2MB or 1GB memory blocks with huge pages
